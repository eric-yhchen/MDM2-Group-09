MDM2 Project 2 - Group 09
Synchronisation of metronomes with feedback

## Files

* `Metronome-Sync` contains files to imitate (two )metronomes syncing by discrete time calculations. [By Dave McCulloch (2020)](https://github.com/dfivesystems/Metronome-Sync.git).
* `metronomes` contains files to model (two) metronomes on a moving cart by solving two coupled SODEs. [By Paul Gribble (2012)](https://github.com/paulgribble/metronomes.git).
* `Previous Study.pdf` details the two models methods and equations.
* `References` contains the papers referenced in `Project.pdf`.

## More

* ~~Come up with some measure of synchronicity -~~ consider velocities as well?
* ~~Parameter sweep the simulation for time to sync~~
* ~~Calculate energy in the system for NC and FLC - should be oscillating~~
* Calculate the energy put in as the integral of this?
* See how to vary the input energy and the results of this
